        Description of the project: Developed using Python, this application streamlines log management. The project's core function involves 
        automating log activity.It employs checksum techniques to identify and eliminate duplicate files, subsequently generating a log file 
        that records the current time and contains detailed information about the removed files.Upon each scheduled run, the application produces
        a comprehensive log file capturing the outcomesof the duplicate file removal process. This log file isthen efficiently sent to a designated
        email address, enabling prompt communication of accomplished actions.
